# Js-Generator

This is the fifth project of my path with OpenClassroom (fourth was about UML, nothing to see on GitHub).

The goal is to make a simple generator of random quotes, the quotes generated doesn't have to make a lot of sense, even if I try to arrange them in this way.

This project was for me the opportunity of learning in a more meaningful way (than lessons) object oriented Javascript.
